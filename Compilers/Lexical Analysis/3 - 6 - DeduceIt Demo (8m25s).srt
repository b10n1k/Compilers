00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,072
Hello. In this video, I'm going to give a
demo of the [inaudible]; a research

2
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:09,094
project in Stanford University for helping
students learn formal systems in online

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:14,067
classes. The basic idea behind the
[inaudible] is to allow students to work

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:19,083
through formal derivations and to have
their improving technology that will check

5
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:24,087
that those derivations are correct. So you
can actually learn the details of how

6
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:29,065
formal reasoning works. So let's take a
look at an example here. So here is a

7
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:34,072
little exercise in algebra and our goal is
to prove that [inaudible]. Is equal to

8
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:39,045
eleven, all right? That's what we're
trying to accomplish and where we start is

9
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:43,099
with the equation two * x + -four = x +
seven. So in general, there could be more

10
00:00:43,099 --> 00:00:49,021
than one initial given assumption in this
particular exercise so it's just one and

11
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:54,012
we wanna start with that equation and we
want to prove that x = eleven. And to get

12
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:58,060
there, we're allowed to use any of the
rules that are listed here that I'm

13
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,051
circling with the mouse. And these were
also divided into two kinds. There are the

14
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:08,019
required rules which is this first set
here at the top. And, the required rules

15
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:12,014
are required. So, whenever we have a step
of [inaudible] that uses one of these

16
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:16,008
rules, we have to name it explicitly, we
have to show that stuff explicitly. And

17
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,082
then there are some rules that are
considered free. These are the rules we

18
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:23,062
don't have to show. So for example, we
don't have to show all these steps

19
00:01:23,062 --> 00:01:27,077
involving associatively of addition and
multiplication, presumably our instructors

20
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:32,007
decide we are already understand that and
we're allowed to skip over those steps and

21
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:36,012
the system will try to fill them in. So
these rules out here we can show them if

22
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:40,016
we like, but they're not required. We're
allowed to skip these steps. All right, so

23
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:45,096
let's begin with. On this and every step
of the derivation is going to have three

24
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:50,083
parts. It's gonna have a conclusion. So
something that we, we are proving at this

25
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:55,090
particular stuff and we're gonna have the
justification. So the rule from which that

26
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,061
step follows. And then finally, what
previous facts we're using that we already

27
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:05,037
knew to be true. All right, So why, what
we started with, what rule we apply to it

28
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:10,020
and then what we concluded from it? All
right? So, what can we do to make progress

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,021
in this example? Well, one thing we could
do is we can add four to both sides of the

30
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:20,041
equation. Okay. And why is that justified?
What rule are we using? Well, that's the

31
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:25,087
balance equation using addition rule up
here which says it's okay to add the same

32
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:31,026
thing both sides of the equation. So, we
would select that rule out of the list of

33
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,098
possible rules. Okay. And then what
assumption are we using? Well, there's

34
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:41,011
only one thing that we've got at the
moment. That's the initial given that we

35
00:02:41,011 --> 00:02:46,036
would begin with. All right, So here, we
have one step of our derivation. We think

36
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:51,081
this is right. We click update proof and
the system. Comes back and says indeed,

37
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:56,073
yes. That was a valid step of the
derivation. So now, let's do another step.

38
00:02:56,073 --> 00:03:01,026
Well actually, let's see what would happen
here if we did this balance equation step

39
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:05,047
incorrectly. Let's say we didn't add the
same thing to both sides. And so, let's

40
00:03:05,047 --> 00:03:09,068
try that out and what do we get? Oh, we
see, then now it comes back to color red

41
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:14,005
indicating there's something wrong and
we're not given another step here to fill

42
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:18,015
in, okay, because there was an incorrect
step. We also see there's this little

43
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:22,074
question mark icon here. We can click on
that. And it tells us something about what

44
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:27,059
went wrong and gives us some advice as it
balancing equation. Means you have to add

45
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:31,062
the same value to each side of the
equation. Okay. So with that advice,

46
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:36,036
presumably we will be able to figure out
what we did wrong and correct this step.

47
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:41,079
And get back to a place where we're on
track. Now as you say there's not always

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:47,044
advice available for every incorrect step
but if it is available, you know you can

49
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:53,025
click on that and get some idea of what it
is you might have done wrong. All right so

50
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:58,081
now let's go on. Let's take a look at this
and see what we could do. We can try to

51
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:04,010
simplify the left hand si de here. So,
that's = two * x on the left hand side and

52
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,040
the right hand side x + seven + four and
we think we can do this here because you

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,062
know? Four + -four are that's just adding
constants and that's one of our free

54
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:19,038
rules, okay? So we're allowed to add up
constants, you know? At the end and

55
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:24,068
getting zero there should be something we
can do for free, all right? And that

56
00:04:24,068 --> 00:04:29,082
follows our previous step. Let me select
that and now we can do an update and it

57
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:34,058
comes back and it says, oh we did
something wrong so it doesn't immediately

58
00:04:34,058 --> 00:04:39,091
follow from the previous step and there's
actually empty here so we can see why and

59
00:04:39,091 --> 00:04:45,030
we see oh, it says [inaudible] identity is
a required rule and so what mistake did we

60
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,025
make? Well, you know it was okay to add
four and -four together and get zero, I'm

61
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:55,038
not sure of that because that was, that
was just adding and multiplying constants

62
00:04:55,038 --> 00:04:59,076
but then the sub-sequence step when we
said the two*x+0 = two*x that it was

63
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:04,018
something. They were actually required to
show in this exercise. So, whenever we use

64
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:08,047
that identity we have to explicitly say
so, so we can, we can fix that. By saying

65
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:13,062
that you know this rule actually, this
step actually, this step actually follows

66
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:19,010
[inaudible] identity from the previous one
and all the other rules that we're using

67
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,019
that stuff for free so we don't have to
name them, alright. So now we can go on.

68
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:29,015
We can although simplify the left hand
side. We might have clean that up and

69
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:34,063
that's just free rules so we don't have to
say exactly which rule we're using and I

70
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:40,012
think I didn't take the update there,
okay. So now, I guess I hit it twice by

71
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:47,026
accident so let's just get rid of one of
these steps, okay. So now what's the next

72
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:55,059
step we're going to perform? It looks like
we need to bring x over to the left hand

73
00:05:55,059 --> 00:06:02,036
side. So, we're going to add a -x to both
sides so two * x + -x = x + eleven + -x,

74
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:08,085
okay? And that's again the balance
equation using addition rule and that

75
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:15,097
follows from our previous step, okay? And,
we can get from that one, all right? And

76
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:22,039
then we'll update that, t hat works just
fine. Okay? And now we can do some

77
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,042
simplification of the left hand side,
sorry excuse me, on the right hand side

78
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:35,008
because all of these over be here is just
= eleven, okay? And, and then we're having

79
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:41,098
to use x + -x = zero and then we're just
adding eleven and zero so we're just count

80
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:48,043
this...adding up constants so this should
follow from additive inverse From the

81
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:53,092
previous step. All right, If we update
that yes that worked out fine and now we

82
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:59,016
just have to work on the left hand side.
We've got two * x + -x and in order to get

83
00:06:59,016 --> 00:07:04,080
that into a form where we can simplify it,
we're gonna need to use the Distributive

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,046
Rule. We need to pull out the constants
that are in front of the x's. And so, we

85
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:15,095
can do that. We can say that two + (-one)
* x = eleven. And so, we're using

86
00:07:15,095 --> 00:07:22,051
distributivity there but we're also using
the unary negation rule that says, you

87
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:28,066
know, -x = -one * x. But that's a free
rule so we don't have to worry about that.

88
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:35,037
So the only rule we need to name is the
distributivity rule. And that falls from

89
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:41,011
the previous step with the deliberation.
We update that, okay. And now we're just

90
00:07:41,011 --> 00:07:47,021
about there so now I think in one step we
can do the simplification. We can subtract

91
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:52,073
one from two and get one and then we have
one*x = eleven. That's multiplicative

92
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:58,049
identity which is a required rule for this
flicker exercise. Falls with the previous

93
00:07:58,049 --> 00:08:03,006
step like all the other, like all the
previous steps and now we're done. And

94
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:07,075
then we prove that x = eleven says who
knows we have finished the assignment and

95
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:11,097
that is the basic idea behind the
[inaudible]. And, while this particular

96
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:16,090
example was algebra this can be done for
any kind of formal system where you can

97
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,094
present the kinds of exercises you want to
do in the set of rules and the students

98
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:25,039
are supposed to derive some kind of goal
using those rules.
